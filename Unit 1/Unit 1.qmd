## Overview

Hello! I am Julia Nielsen and I am trying to spread awareness about the Indigenous tribe, Ticuna, for my U.S. History class.
 There is an artist named We'e'ena Ticuna who makes music on Spotify at this link. She bases her music on the traditional songs of her tribe. 
 There is also a virtual tour of the Museu Nacional in Brazil at this link. Here is the website of the museum. 
 Thank you so much for exploring and appreciating this culture.
